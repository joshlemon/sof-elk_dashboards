# SOF-ELK DFIR Dashboards

These are a few [SOF-ELK](https://github.com/philhagen/sof-elk) Dashboards that I've built and found useful for DFIR Cases. You're welcome to use these or suggest updates to them via Pull request.

A lot of these Dashboards were developed from when I've been teaching the [SANS Enterprise Cloud Forensics Class (FOR509)](https://sans.org/for509) - it's a cool course if you want to learn more about Cloud Forensics.
