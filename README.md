# SOF-ELK DFIR Dashboards

These are a few [SOF-ELK](https://github.com/philhagen/sof-elk) Dashboards that I've built and found useful for DFIR Cases. You're welcome to use these or suggest updates to them via Pull request.

A lot of these Dashboards were developed from performing Cloud log analysis, but hopefully it will include others....as I get time to create them.
